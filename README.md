# Html-code-generation-from-LLM


### Objective: 
Fine-Tuning and Evaluating a Falcon 7B Model for HTML Code Generation. 

### Dataset:
 [jawerty/html_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jawerty/html_dataset) from Hugging Face Datasets containing pairs of natural language prompts and corresponding HTML code. Consists of.....


### Process (steps and challenges) 
1. Model selection
2. Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing 
3. Model Fine tuning script(setting hyperparameters and choosing fine tuning techniques and regularization) 
4. Model Evaluation
5. API development to serve the model
